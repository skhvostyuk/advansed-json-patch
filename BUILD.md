## Preamble

All instructions in this file use the Linux (or other Unix) conventions for build. If you happen to use Windows,
replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew.bat`.

## Building instructions

### Gradle usage

You may be fortunate enough that your IDE has Gradle support. Should it not be the case, first report a bug to your
vendor; then refer to the cheat sheet below:

```
# List the list of tasks
./gradlew tasks
# Build, test the package
./gradlew test
# Install in your local maven repository
./gradlew clean install
```

If you try and play around with Gradle configuration files, in order to be
_really sure_ that your modifications are accounted for, add the
`--recompile-scripts` option before the task name; for instance:

```
./gradlew --recompile-scripts test
```

## Note to Maven users

There exists a possiblity to generate a `pom.xml` (using `./gradlew pom`), which is there for convenience. However, this
is not supported by the author.
